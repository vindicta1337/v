      <p>The world is full of beings who do terrible things. Why not terminate them? Exactly, that would be immoral. <br>
    But what are morals? Morals are your brain trying to protect your soul from getting infected. <br>
 <b>You</b> are your soul, not your body. Your body is mortal but your soul isn't. This is the reason why you likely do not commit terrible acts. <br>
Think of it like this, if you get tattooed you overthink every motive you get imprinted on you, because it will stay for the rest of your earthly life.
But everything you fill your soul with is forever. <br>
The soul can be charged with either positive, neutral or negative energy. If on the point of your death, your soul is overweighed with negative energy, you cannot find peace.
<br> Ever wonder why so many death encounterers claim to return to consciousness and eternal peace and yet there are so many sightings of <b>Ghosts</b>? <br>
And why are Ghosts mostly either evil or trying to contact their earthly familiy? Think about it. It's simple. <br>
Souls that could not find peace either turn into ghosts or get <b>reincarnated</b>. It is thus important that you die a natural death. Yes, accidents are natural. <br>
In the time of your death, remind yourself that this does not mean the end. While you are on earth it is your duty to fill your soul with as much positive energy as possible. <br>
If something brings you positivy, do it, no matter what. Do not let anyone tell you otherwise. </p>

    </h2>

      <p>Murder and suicide are 2 things that can cause your soul to become stuck on earth.
        While murder depends on the context, a being with a soul will likely be haunted by it until the end, wich means, forever.
        Suicide however means willingly causing the end. <br> 
        Suicide almost always means huge pain and is usually only actually acted upon in situations of immense stress and depression. <br>
        The problem with it is, that if you die with energies of stress and depression, your soul will be immensely disturbed, likely causing you to become a ghost. <br>
        A number of ghost sightings are in houses or places where people have been murdered, executed, or ended their lives through suicide. <br>
        Your soul can be trained and feeded with good energy through art, meditation, spirituality, music and most importantly <b>nature</b>! <br>
        Nature cleans the soul.
